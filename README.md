# React-Appointments-
This is a simple React app. It mocks an appointments app. It barely has any style, but I created it to get better at writing and using React.
### Features of the app:
A user types their name, phone number and email address into a form, and after submiting, the person's contact details are presented onto the screen. There cannot be two contacts with the same name. Then a user navigates to an appointments page, where they enter why and when the appointment should be, and upon submission, the details will show up on the screen.

This is a very simple app, but I will be adding more features to it to make it better but mostly to practice REACTing.
